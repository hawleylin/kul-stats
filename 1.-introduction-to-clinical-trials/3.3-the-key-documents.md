# 3.3 The key documents

## 3.3.1 Protocol

Every well-designed study requires a protocol. **The protocol is a written agreement between the Sponsor, the Investigator\(s\), the Participants, and the Scientific Community**. It provides a comprehensive description of the study with notably the following items

* Objective\(s\)
* Treatment\(s\)
* Endpoint\(s\)
* Procedures
* Data analysis to assess the objectives.

![an example of table of content](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

### Objectives: key foundation of a good experiment

Generally, the objectives will reflect the type of comparison expected to be evaluated whether the main objective of the trial is to show Superiority, Non-Inferiority, …——通常，目标将反映预期进行评估的比较类型，而试验的主要目标是否是显示优越性，非劣等性……

* Cover the different aspects of the problem and its contributing factors in a coherent way and in a logical sequence;
* Are clearly phrased in operational terms, specifying exactly what you are going to do, where, and for what purpose;
* Are realistic considering local conditions;
* Use action verbs that are specific enough to be evaluated \(Examples of action verbs are: to determine, to compare, to verify, to calculate, to describe, and to establish\). Avoid the use of vague non-action verbs \(Examples of non-action verbs: to appreciate, to understand, or to study\)
* Keep in mind that when the project is evaluated, the results will be compared to the objectives. If the objectives have not been spelled out\(讲清楚\) clearly, the project cannot be evaluated.

### Endpoints \(variable\) ：the measurable characteristics or outcomes

An endpoint is a direct or indirect measurement of a clinical or pharmacological effect and measured in the individual patient. The timepoint\(s\) or time frame at which the endpoint is assessed should be specified.

> 可以分为objective（survival, occurrence of a disease exacerbation恶化 , a disease improvement, clinical event like stroke for instance例如中风）和subjective\(pain, dyspnea scale呼吸困难量表, quality of life\)

A **surrogate endpoint \(as opposed to direct\)** is an indirect endpoint like a laboratory measure or a physical sign that is intended to be used as a **substitute** for a clinically meaningful endpoint.

Use of Surrogate Endpoint assume that the treatment effect is mediated by the pathway represented by the Surrogate Endpoint. However, multiple pathways may exist.

</table>### Study Cohort or Study Population

he Study Cohort or Study Population defines the subjects/patients conditions for being eligible to participate in the trial. The criteria \(inclusion/exclusion\) must be defined and should closely reflect the targeted population.

### Study design overview

The study design overview provides a snapshot with the main characteristics of the study: treatment arms\(治疗组\), number of patients, some specific interventions,…

The overview do also provide a description of the design configuration（设计布局） that can be Parallel Group Design, Cross-over Design, Factorial Design, Case-Control Design,…. \(see Part II.2.2.3 and II.2.2.4 for further details\).

### Randomization and Blinding

The Randomization and Blinding section describes the method for randomization \(see Part II.2.1 & II.2.2 for further details\) as well as the level of blinding \(see \) and how it is maintained throughout the study conduct and especially in case of interim analysis.

### Data Evaluation

As part of the Data Evaluation, besides providing some details on the different data analysis intent to be performed, the section:

* Provides justification for the sample size being large enough to provide a reliable answer to the scientific questions but not too large for not exposing unnecessary patients to new treatment not fully evaluated as well as contain cost. In practice either the sample size is fairly fixed by investment considerations \(typically in early development\) or there is a formal statistical hypothesis to be ruled out. In the first case, the section consist rather in describing the expected precision of the treatment effect estimates. In the second case, the following items should be specified: the endpoint, the null/alternative hypotheses, the test statistic or decision criteria, the type I error \( $$α$$ \), and the type II error \( $$β$$ \) \(see Part II.3 for further details\). In both case, assumptions about the expected treatment effect in both control and investigational product\(s\) must be provided with appropriate references;
* Provides a description of the study cohorts or analysis population to be considered for evaluating the study objectives \(see Section3.3.4\);
* Provides the sequence of analyses that are planned to be performed: final and interim analyses together with the need for an adjustment to the type I error \(see Part II.4.4 for further details\).

### Estimand

**Estimand Concept：**

An estimand is a parameter which is to be estimated in a statistical analysis. 

{% hint style="info" %}
注意estimand、estimator以及estimate之间的区别  
                                         ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png) 
{% endhint %}

An estimand reflects what is to be estimated to address the scientific question of interest events that occur after treatment initiation and either preclude（阻碍） observation of the variable\(s\) or affect its interpretation

</table>#### Strategies for addressing Intercurrent Events

* Treatment policy strategy \(TPS\): The occurrence of the intercurrent event is **irrelevant** \(ITT principle\)…the intercurrent event is considered to **be part of the treatments** being compared  📚 ——并发事件不可逆，成为treatment的一部分
* Composite strategy \(CS\): The occurrence of the intercurrent event is taken to be **a component of the variable/endpoint**  📚 ——并发事件成为变量/结束点的一部分。例如，因为中毒而停止治疗的病人可能被认为没有得到成功的治疗。如果结果变量是已经成功或失败，停止毒性治疗将被简单地视为另一种失败模式。
* Hypothetical strategy \(HS\): A scenario is envisaged in which the intercurrent event would not occur: the value of the variable to reflect the clinical question of interest is the value which the variable would have taken in the hypothetical scenario defined  📚 设想了一种不会发生并发事件的情况:反映所研究的临床问题的变量的值就是该变量在已定义的假想情况中所取的值
* Principal stratum strategy \(PSS\): Classification of subjects according to the potential occurrence of an intercurrent event on either or both treatments  📚 根据可能在其中一个或两个治疗中同时发生的并发事件对受试者进行分类。例如人们可能希望了解在接种疫苗后受感染的主要人群中，治疗对感染严重程度的影响。
* While on treatment strategy \(WTS\): Response to treatment prior to the occurrence of the intercurrent event is of interest. Particular care is required if the occurrence of the intercurrent event differs between the treatments being compared  📚 研究兴趣：在并发事件发生之前对治疗的反应。但如果正在比较的治疗之间发生的并发事件不同，则需要特别注意

</table>注意：To apply “Treatment Policy” strategy in a design where early discontinuers are not followed extensively off treatment , it is necessary to assume noninformative missingness。若要在设计中应用“治疗策略”策略，而不广泛地跟踪早期停药者的治疗情况，则必须假定无信息性遗漏

## 3.3.2 – Inform Consent Form（ICF）

1、Subject voluntary or legally authorized representative \(LAR\) confirms willingness to participate  
2、ICF copy given to subject  
3、Information process to be well documented  
4、Written, signed & dated Informed Consent Form \(ICF\)

* After being informed of all aspects of study
* Prior to study participation
* Informed Consent Form \(ICF\) used to inform subject\* about research Investigational Product、Study Procedures、Treatment assignment、Duration of trial、Treatment Alternatives、Risk / benefits、Access to medical records、Confidentiality、Payment / financial benefits、Contact person, etc...

## 3.3.4 – Statistical Analysis Plan

More technical and detailed document describing the analyses:

* detailed statistical methods applied on the different endpoints to evaluate the different objectives
* derived variables detailed descriptions of the data transformation
* handling of missing data. ---Missing values represent a potential source of bias。然而当缺失值是随机的，与研究的治疗（investigational treatment）等无关，或者处理方案\(protocol\)和/或统计分析计划\(SAP\)中预先定义的缺失值的方法是明智的\(sensible\)时，它并不妨碍从试验中得出（derive）有效的结论
* Analysis population definition \(Intent To Treat意图治疗, According to Protocol\)

## 3.3.5 – Investigator Brochure

It describes the unmet medical need, the target product profile and previous acquired data with the treatment/medicine. At the start of human research experiments, it will consist primarily or entirely of in-vitro or animal experiments. It is then regularly updated with the accrual（累积） of human data. Based on this document, the investigator will decide to participate in a clinical trial or not.

## 3.3.6 – Common Technical Dossier汇总
