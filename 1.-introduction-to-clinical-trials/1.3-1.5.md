# 1.3-1.5 Why and how perform CTs

## 1.3 Why performing Clinical Trials?

* the validity of research is based on the accumulation of scientific evidences through experiments of which clinical trials belongs to.
* advances（进步） in medical practice are based on research
* 最终目的：**To answer question\(s\) in a scientific manner to perform a valid research**

## 1.4 How often do we perform CTs?

**Statistics is an important applied sciences to ensure the scientific validity of the trial conduct and its conclusions. Statistics play an important role at each steps of the process:**

1. An **adequate study design** is needed to collect the appropriate data for answering the specific questions under study;
2. **Proper sample size computation** is needed to ensure the study is adequately powered and allow control of Type I error to evaluate the study objective\(s\) and decide on next steps **\(risk management\)**
3. Proper approaches such as randomization are in place to **control and minimize any potential bias**. As described later in the course:
4. The broad range of statistical methodologies permits to transform data collected into useful information/evidences, ranging from descriptive summary tables to comparison between groups

> a. A bias is any process which tends to produce results or conclusions that differ systematically from the truth——产生与真理有系​​统地不同的结果/结论
>
> b. There is bias when the observed difference between two groups is due to another factor than the treatment under study——当两组之间观察到的差异归因于所研究治疗之外的其他因素时

### **bias种类**

* **Evaluation bias.** When the measure of the endpoint is not performed the same way in the different groups. Randomization and Blinding of the assessors should limit this bias
* **Analytical bias** arises when results are evaluated with a non-adequate methodology.

> 具体来说，bias is the difference \(generally unknown\) between a laboratory's average value for an assay performed repeatedly on a sample and the average that would be achieved by the reference laboratory if it undertook the same measurements——偏差是指实验室对样本重复执行的测定的平均值与参考实验室进行相同测量所获得的平均值之间的差  
> More generally, the bias of an estimator is the difference between an estimator's expectations and the true value of the parameter being estimated. ——估计量的偏差是估计量的期望值与被估计参数的真实值之间的差

* **Confusion bias** arises when other factors, called **confounding factors**, that may induce variability in the results are not taken into account. Such factors should be proactively controlled via adequate study design and statistical methodology.

#### **Confusion bias example**

Drug B \(success in 90% of the cases\) sounds to provide better outcome than Drug A \(success in 70% of the cases. Applying either a Fisher Exact Test or an asymptotic 95% confidence interval indicate a statistical significance between both drugs. B明显好于A  
                                                    ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2824%29.png)  
然而，如果我们assume that a biological marker was assessed prior to treatment administration with patients being either positive or negative for that marker，得到以下表。再次查看药物之间成功比例的差异，对于每种基线生物标志物状态，药物B是否优于药物A却不obvious了，甚至A貌似优于B

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2859%29.png)

这个简单的例子说明了混杂因素（例如baseline biomarker status基线生物标志物状态）如何影响结论或至少影响结论的能力

* 在两种生物标志物状态之间，接受药物A或药物B的患者**比例差异很大**。在设计研究时应确定此类预后因素\(prognostic factors\)，以通过方案纳入/排除标准限制目标人群或分层招募患者，以使治疗在两个生物标记物状态亚群（sub-populations）中**平均分配**。
* 在当前示例中，接受药物B的基线生物标志物状态为阴性的患者非常有限（10例），可能不宜考虑asymptotic confidence interval，而应考虑Fisher Exact Test（双向Pr &lt; = P 0.7410）。另一方面，它质疑了前面的overall analysis indicating药物B优于药物A。

## 1.5 How to generate valid data in clinical trials ?

{% hint style="info" %}
**1、Randomisation which ensure minimisation of bias at study entry**

**2、Blinding which ensure minimisation of bias during the clinical trial with regard to treatment effect**
