# 3.1 Key steps: From planning to disclosure

## 3.1.1 Planning

The planning step includes all activities, before **the first subject first visit\(FSFV\)**, aiming at preparing the study. It **lasts usually between 6 and 12 months and** generally covers, at least:

* Define study rational, objectives, procedures **\(Protocol\)**
* **Define data to be collected \(Case Report Form\)**
* Identify investigational sites
* Perform study feasibility and sites assessment
* Develop **Inform Consent Form \(ICF\)**--知情同意书
* Prepare study logistics \(e.g.: drug supply, devices, samples collection, …\)
* Develop treatment allocation & data collection tools \(e.g.: treatment allocation IVRS/IWRS, Electronic Data Capture, ePROs device, Images collection,…\)
* Specify expectations \(e.g.: data collections guidelines, logistic guidelines,..\)
* Get regulatory approbation \(Ethics committees\)--监管认可
* Initiate sites \(e.g.: train the investigation sites, ensure they have capability/capacity\)

## 3.1.2 Conduct

**Between FSFV and Last Subject Last Visit \(LSLV\). Lasts between few months and years**

* Recruit subjects/patients
* Explain the trial rational, objectives, risks/benefits,…
* Obtain subjects/patients consent
* Have the subjects/patients going through the study procedures
* Collect the required data and report them into the Case Report Form
* Ensure subjects/patients care at any time
* Amend Protocol, Case Report Form,… as needed but allowed
* Detail the **Statistical Analysis Plan \(SAP\)**
* Interact with the Sponsor to ensure data quality
* Obtain all data \(Case Report Form data, Samples analyses data, …\) to reach database lock

## 3.1.3 Reporting

**Between LSLV and till after Study Closure. Lasts between 6-18 months**

* Analyse the data to answer study objectives
* Interpret the results
* Compile the study results into Study Report
* Disclose the study results externally \(Clinical Trial Register, publications,…\)
