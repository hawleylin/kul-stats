</table>## 2.2 The Target Product Profile\(TPP\)

The Target Product profile \(TPP\) is a document with an adequate format for discussions between a sponsor and the Authorities that can be used throughout the drug development process

> ideally as expressed in terms of its SmPC \(Summary of Product Characteristics\), package leaflet and promotional concepts

Based on disease burden, the document describes ideal/anticipated product profile to reach an unmet\(未满足的\) medical need:

* Expected intervention \(dosage, schedule, …\)
* Expected benefits \(i.e. intervention effect\)
* Targeted Population
* Safety profile

It identifies the various scientific evidences that will need to be accumulated during the product development and ensure adequate Benefits/Risks assessment and balance.

## 2.3 The Clinical Development Plan

The Clinical Development Plan is a document that maps out the proposed series of clinical trials that will allow the drug to reach the market with the characteristics outlined in the TPP.

> 换句话说，it documents the sequence of studies that will be executed in order to gather the scientific evidences supporting demonstration of the efficacy and safety of the new investigational medicine. 一般分为不同的阶段（比如Phase I to IV）

A Good Clinical Development Plan

* Meet patient needs and regulatory expectations
* Enhance the medicine potential optimizing the benefit-risk balance
* Apply a stage-gate\(门径管理\) approach to manage risks 1. Patient safety 2. Limit late stage medicine failure due to poor clinical design or strategy 3. Flexible to adjust if there are unexpected findings
