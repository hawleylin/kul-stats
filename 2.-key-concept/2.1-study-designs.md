# Chapter 1: Study Designs

## 1.1 Definition and overview

There are two types of clinical trials according to the involvement of randomization

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2851%29.png)

## 1.2 Randomization

### Definition

A randomized trial is a type of trial in which study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study.

### Advantages

* Remove the potential bias in treatment assignment：conscious or subconscious
* Randomization tends to produce comparable groups:  known or unknown prognostic variables
* Validity of statistical tests of significance is guaranteed：independent & identical distribution, exchangeability, permutation test\(排列检验\)

> As indicated in ICH E-9, randomized clinical trials allow the greatest reliability and validity of statistical estimates of treatment effects

### Objections to randomization

* May deprive a patient from receiving a new and better therapy--但在新治疗没被证实有效之前，接受新治疗的对象也被剥夺了接受现有治疗的权力
* Is not ethical, especially when a placebo control is used--但；而且placebo不一定需要完全无效，可以是预防其他疾病的药物；新疗法也可以在接受安慰剂之后提供给受试者；不用placebo会有非劣效性研究的风险
* Is creating anxiety and therefore may result in low enrolment--但临床试验比任何市场上的治疗提供更好的随访。它是由伦理委员会批准以确保
* Perceived as no need
* Not efficient \(sometimes alternative designs could be considered\)--如果是Adaptive randomization会在中期研究增加新疗法的人数，如果新疗法有效的情况下

      </td>
    </tr>

</table>#### ② Block randomization

Block of treatment with desired allocation ratio, which means that each block respects the randomization ratio. Sequence of treatments is randomly permuted in each block.

                                                         ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2856%29.png) 

Advantages:

* Allows a better control to reach the targeted group ratio. After completing the allocation within a block, one is sure that the number of enrolled subjects is respecting the randomization ratio
* Complete blocks can be dedicated to specific populations \(e.g.: male versus female, severe disease history versus moderate disease history, center\) to control that treatment allocation is respecting the target in each specific population.

  Note: A prognosis \(or prognostic\) factor is a patient characteristic that influences the clinical trial outcome/endpoint of interest. Prognosis factor will be used to define specific population for which respect of randomization ratio is required.

Disadvantages:

* risk of unblinded allocation if lack of allocation concealment. When the block size is known, the investigator may know in advance what will be the next treatment allocated. 例如block size和study groups都是2，当第一个病人被分配到treatment A的时候，研究者知道下一个病人接受的治疗是B For this reason ICH E-9 recommends **using multiple block size**\(换句话说，就是**block size大于study groups**，例如a block size of 4 in a 2 groups study\) or, at least, **keeping the investigator blinded to the block size.**
* As the number of incomplete blocks increases at study end, there is an increased risk of departing from the target group ratio at study end. For instance, if a block is dedicated to a study center and each center enrolls only one subject, the blocking scheme randomization will be equivalent to a simple randomization.

#### ③ Minimization randomization

1. Algorithm that balance treatments over several prognostic factors \(=minimization factors\)

> randomization by minimization uses specific algorithm with categorical prognosis factors to control in real time the respect of the targeted randomization ratio for each category of each prognosis factor.--最小化随机化是利用带有分类预后因子的特定算法来实时控制每个预后因子的每个类别的目标随机化比率。

   2. Allocation of a subject depends on current unbalance for each minimization factor

> The treatment allocation for a subject/patient depends on the value of the prognosis factors for the subject and the current imbalance among subjects already enrolled. These factors are named minimization factors. --对受试者/患者的治疗分配取决于受试者预后因素的价值和已入组受试者之间的当前不平衡。这些因素被称为最小化因素。

方法：根据subject所属的factors，计算AB在相关minimization factors的上的人数（即score），较少的treatment分到subject。目的在于minimize the amount of imbalance, in terms of prognostic factors

            ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2816%29.png) 

There is possibility to adapt the algorithm:

* To take into account the importance of prognosis factors by computing a weighted score                                          ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2884%29.png) 
* To take into account randomization different from 1:1. In a randomization 1:x for treatment A:B, the score of treatment A would be multiply by x to compare to the score from treatment B.

> To prevent the minimization algorithm from being completely deterministic, some elements of randomness are incorporated into the minimization algorithm, to prevent knowledge of the next treatment allocation. Typically the algorithm will use the minimization algorithm in x % of the cases and will follow the simple randomization in 100%-x% of the cases. X% is named the degree of determinism.  
>                                                      ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

Advantages:

* Treatment balance is controlled for each prognosis factor independently from each other---There is a good control of the treatment allocation ratio for many prognosis factors.
* Predictability is masked by allocating randomly only a proportion of the subjects---There is no 100% predictability.

Disadvantages:

* A central randomization is needed to have a continuous up-to-date status of enrolment\( see for [instance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01545.x)\)
* For randomization different from 1:1, traditional tests may not be valid

#### ④ Adaptive to outcome randomization

The randomization ratio is changing over time based on treatment outcome observed in the previous subjects. 

> 具体方法：The following figure illustrates such randomization. For the first subject the randomization is fixed according to the initial randomization ratio, for instance 1:1 by picking up a bowl from an urn containing the same number of white \(corresponding to allocating the subject to treatment A\) and black bowls \(corresponding to allocating to treatment B\). The number of bowls in the urn is adapted by adding a bowl corresponding to the treatment at each positive response to the treatment so that at the next allocation there is an increase chance to allocate the best treatment  
>                                                        ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)   
> 第一个受试者根据初始的随机化比例选择。如果是1:1，从黑白球数量一致的碗里拿出一个球。容器的数量根据球对应的治疗是积极治疗而调整，这样以便在下次分配增加分配到最好的治疗方法的机会。

Advantages: Optimization as per defined criterion – less hurt/more benefit. 优化是基于每次明确的标准。Subjects/patients have increased chance to get the best treatment.

Disadvantages:

* Outcome must be quickly available. 从逻辑上讲，这种算法是可能的，如果在治疗后能够快速观察到感兴趣的结果。
* The standard statistical tests are not valid. An analysis according to the randomization algorithm must be used to test the null hypothesis of identical outcome between treatment groups.必须根据随机化算法进行分析，以检验治疗组之间结果相同的原假设。

#### ⑤ Stratified randomization

1. Stratification is done separately according to prognostic factors \(eg age when endpoint is death\) 
2. Center is a usual stratification factor when enrolment by center is compatible with block size
3. Simple/block/minimization can be used independently within each stratum

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

Advantages:

* This ensures that the groups are comparable with respect to these important prognosis factors
* This also allows to control for the profile of the enrolled population when randomization is central.

Disadvantages: The number of stratum must stay reasonable \(&lt; 5\) to ensure global balance

{% hint style="info" %}
Minimization factors and stratification factors are not interchangeable. Indeed minimization factors are not independently used for allocating a subject in a minimization algorithm.

The ICH E-9 and CHMP/295050/Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials indicates that the primary analysis should reflect the restriction on the randomization i.e. stratification/minimization variables should be included as co-variables in the primary analysis unless the variables were set up for administrative reason.

  </tbody>
</table>### Techniques of blinding

#### 1. The use of a placebo as control

A placebo is an inactive, fake, or dummy medication or treatment designed to resemble a drug or treatment and given in the same way. Such a control can be either a non active placebo compound or the standard of care \(i.e., an already marketed product\).

The placebo needs to be validated and emergency unblinding procedures need to be put in place.---Therefore short term effect, logistical aspect should be questioned in order to ensure blinding is successful.

#### 2. Double dummy

Double dummies are used when the treatments to compare cannot be made identical. **Placebo are prepared for each treatment**.

It may become cumbersome with large treatment\(每个人不止接受一次治疗，x treatments to administer for a instead of one\), or may not be possible \(eg oral vs IM\)

### Risk of unblinding

* Mechanism: e.g. beta-carotene \(yellowing skin\)--含有-胡萝卜素的产品可诱导皮肤变黄，placebo如果做不到这一点，可能会导致致盲失效
* Characteristic side effects \(e.g.: 9cRA\)
* Participants comparing drugs in the waiting room
* Participants try to find out
* Oversight in labeling, lab testing

## 1.4 Designs of randomized studies

### Parallel Design

Parallel randomized clinical study is the most commonly used randomized design. Subjects under each treatment group are different. The randomization ratio is not necessarily 1:1

> Advantages: There is no bias associated to carry-over \(see cross-over\)
>
> Disadvantage: May not be optimal when cross-over or paired design can be used

### Cross-Over Design

A subject receives multiple treatments to compare **sequentially**  
                                                         ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2862%29.png) 

Advantage: lower sample size required because the treatment effect is measured within a subject

Disadvantage: assume no carry-over effect, but this may not be possible \(eg long term effect, surgery, …\)

> To prevent such effect, there is typically a waiting period \(named washout period\) to allow the subjects to get back to his original status before administering the next treatment

### Paired Design

A subject receives multiple treatments to compare **simultaneously**   
                                                          ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png) 

Advantage: lower sample size required because the treatment effect is measured within a subject

Disadvantage: assume no interference. However, outcome may be influenced by the other treatments

### Cluster Randomized Design

Cluster of subjects are randomized between groups. Groups \(named cluster\) of subjects are randomized instead of individual subjects  
                                                      ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png) 

[Advantages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23158882): It is the only option for looking at **community strategy** which involves direct and indirect effect

Disadvantages:

* Requires larger sample size than parallel design. In order to obtain the same power as the unit becomes the cluster
* Less unit =&gt; higher risk of failure in randomization. For example,  ① It is more complex to ensure comparable clusters are allocated to each intervention. ② Greater complexity in design and analysis as the cluster effect \(i.e., dependence of outcome in subjects within the same cluster\) has to be accounted for.
* Blinding is a challenge. If one subject unblinded, then all subjects in the cluster are unblinded

### Factorial design

Two or more treatments are evaluated simultaneously in the same set of subjects through various combinations. Factorial design is used to investigate independently effect of multiple factors.  
                                                  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png) 

Advantages: Lower sample size required than running 2 studies if the treatments do not interact\(假设AB与CD没有interaction，那么此时如果我们测量A和B的不同，比较AC+AD与BC+BD即可\). If there aresome interactions, it allows investigating the effect of multiple factors independently and understand potential interactions

Disadvantages: Assumption that the treatments do not interact may not be valid. ----There may be interaction between the effect so that the effect measures is different from the effect that would have been measured in parallel design studies.

## 1.5 Observational study designs

By design, observational studies are non-randomized. All such designs have the disadvantage of nonrandomized studies \(i.e., treatment effect may be biased by other effects, named confounding factors\). Therefore results from such studies must be corroborated by other studies before conclusions can be considered reliable. --根据设计，观察性研究是非随机的。所有这些设计都有非随机化研究的缺点\(即，治疗效果可能会受到其他影响的影响，称为混杂因素\)。因此，这些研究的结果必须得到其他研究的证实，才能被认为是可靠的结论。

![The choice of the design impacts on reliability &amp; cost](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2863%29.png)

It must be clear that the above pyramid of evidence is a guideline as:

1. The level of evidence of a case-control study might be better than a blinded RCT if the latest is not well conducted
2. The context might influence the level of evidence as described in below figure
