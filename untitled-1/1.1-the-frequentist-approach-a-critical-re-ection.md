# 1.1 The frequentist approach: a critical reﬂection

## 1.1.1 The classical statistical approach

Mix of two approaches **\(Fisher** & **Neyman and Pearson**\)

Here: based on P-value, significance level, power and confidence interval

> example：Toenail RCT
>
> * Two treatments \(A : Lamisil and B : Itraconazol\) on 2 × 189 patients
> * Significance level α = 0.05， Sample size to ensure that β ≤ 0.20
> * $$\bm{A:\mu_1\ and\ B:\mu_2}$$   $$\bm{H_0: \delta = \mu_1 - \mu2_1 = 0}$$ 
> * Completion of study: $$\hat{\delta}=1.38$$ with $$t_{obs}=2.19$$ in 0.05 rejection region
> * Neyman-Pearson: reject that A and B are equally eﬀective
> * Fisher: 2-sided P = 0.030 ⇒ strong evidence against null hypothesis

注意两点！  
① only in Fisher approach, we use P-value and evidence  
②Wrong statement: Result is significant at 2-sided α of 0.030----because the p value is not predetermined

## 1.1.2 The P-value as a measure of evidence

### **①**The P-value is not the probability that $$H_0$$ is \(not\) true

P-value = probability that observed or a more extreme result occurs⇒⇒⇒P-value = **surprise index  
观察到的或更极端的结果发生的概率**

                                                            $$P\ value \neq p(H_0 | y) = Bayesian\ probability$$ 

### ②The P-value depends on ﬁctive data \(Example I.2\)

P-value is based not only on the observed result but also on **ﬁctive \(never observed\)** data

Probability has a **long-run frequency deﬁnition**

### ③The P-value depends on the sample space \(Examples I.3 and I.4\)

Calculation of P-value depends on all possible samples \(under H0 \)--Under H0 is because we try to simulate H0

The **possible** samples are similar in some characteristics to the observed sample\(e.g. same sample size\)

e.g. different choice\(比如不同的test方法\) can lead to different possible sample sets   
→different sample space   
→different p value and significance level→different conclusion

### ④The P-value is not an absolute measure

* Small P-value **does not** necessarily **indicate large difference** between treatments, strong association, etc.
* Interpretation of a small P-value in a small/large study
* When does H 0 occur in practice?

Large study tend to smaller p-value. Why? Because H0 almost dose not occur in practice

→the deviations against H0 are more likely to occur in large study

**→ increase use of Confidence interval rather than p-value**

### ⑤The P-value does not take all evidence into account \(Example I.5\)

Studies are analysed in isolation, **no reference to historical data**

## 1.1.3 The conﬁdence interval as a measure of evidence

95% conﬁdence interval: **expression of uncertainty** on parameter of interest

> 例子：95% conﬁdence interval for ∆ = \[0.14, 2.62\]  
> Interpretation: most likely \(with 0.95 probability\) ∆ lies between 0.14 and 2.62 = a Bayesian interpretation

**Technical deﬁnition**: in 95 out of 100 studies true parameter is enclosed

In each study conﬁdence interval includes/does not include true value

Practical interpretation has a Bayesian nature

{% tab title="comparison" %}
• Fisher and Neyman & Pearson in a never-ending debate

• In practice two approaches are mixed

• Other measures \(Bayes factor\) have been proposed as measure for or against an hypothesis

• Bayesian inference and P-value are close in one-sided hypothesis test
