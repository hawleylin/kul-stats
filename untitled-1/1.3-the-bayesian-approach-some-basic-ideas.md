# 1.3 The Bayesian approach: some basic ideas

## 1.3.1 Introduction

Examples I.7 and I.8: combination of information from a similar historical surgical technique could be used in the evaluation of current technique = **Bayesian exercise**

Planning phase III study:

* Comparison new ⇔ old treatment for treating breast cancer .
* Background information is incorporated when writing the protocol
* Background information is not incorporated in the statistical analysis
* Suppose small-scaled study with unexpectedly positive result \(P &lt; 0.01\) ⇒ Reaction???

New mouthwash

* Daily use of the new mouthwash before tooth brushing reduces plaque?
* Results: new mouthwash reduced 25% of plaque with a 95% CI = \[10%, 40%\] 
* Previous trials: overall reduction in plaque in-between 5% and 15% 
* Experts: plaque reduction will probably not exceed 30%
* What to conclude then?

Central idea of Bayesian approach: Combine **likelihood \(data\)** with **Your** prior knowledge \(**prior probability**\) to update information on the parameter to result in a revised probability associated with the parameter \(**posterior probability**\)--结合似然\(数据\)和先验知识\(先验概率\)来更新参数信息，从而得到与参数相关的修正概率\(后验概率\)

## 1.3.2 Bayes theorem

$$A$$ \(diseased\) & $$B$$ \(positive diagnostic test\)            $$A^C$$\(not diseased\) & $$B^C$$\(negative diagnostic test\)

 $$p(A,B)=p(A)*p(B|A)=p(B)*p(A|B)$$ 

Bayes theorem = **Theorem on Inverse Probability**   $$\boxed{p(B|A)=\dfrac{p(A|B)*p(B)}{p(A)}}$$ 

Bayes’ Theorem - version II:  $$\boxed{p(B|A)= \dfrac{p(A|B)*p(B)}{p(A|B)*p(B)+p(A|B^C)*p(B^C)}}$$
